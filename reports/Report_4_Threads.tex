\section{How to improve the labwork} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item First we declare a dim3 blockSize 
\item Then we declare the grid size by dividing the width and height by the blockSize corresponding dimension 
\item We declare a kernel with the previous declared blockSize and gridSize 
\item In the grayscale function, you add the 2nd dimension by calculting the length of a line, multiplying it by 
the row index, and adding it to the current index. 
\end{itemize} 

\section{What's the speed up ?}

Using this method, the code is slower than labwork3 by about 3 times.
