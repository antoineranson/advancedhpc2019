\section{How to implement the code ?} 
To achieve the purpose we need to : 
\begin{itemize} 
\item get the number of pixel to process 
\item allocate memory from the host for the output image 
\item allocate memory from the device to store the input image and the output image 
\item copy the image from the host to the device 
\item process it 
\item copy the processed image from the device to the host 
\item clean the device memory 
\end{itemize} 
Check the code for more detail.
 
\section{What's the speedup ?} 
Using this implementation we have the following results :\newline 
USTH ICT Master 2018, Advanced Programming for HPC\newline 
Warming up... \newline 
Starting labwork 3 \newline 
labwork 1 CPU ellapsed 3068.9ms \newline
labwork 3 GPU ellapsed 112.7ms \newline 
So the acceleration is of about 30 times with a 64 block size. 

\section{With different block size}
Increasing the block size is making the program slower.
